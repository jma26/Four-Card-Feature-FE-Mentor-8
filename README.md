## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge was similar to my previous challenges. I wanted to make sure that I was not losing touch on CSS Grid and utilizing best practices for semantic HTML since it's been awhile I've completed a challenge (new job so not a lot of free time!)
